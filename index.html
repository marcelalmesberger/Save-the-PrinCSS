                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                You are a brave knight on a quest to save the beautiful princess who was kidnapped by an evil dragon. After an exhausting
                journey through the whole kingdom to gather information about the dragon's nest you finally got enough clues to identify the
                exact location of its lair. The nest is situated on top of the highest mountain you have ever seen. Reaching the lair will be
                a demanding task and you gather all your power and begin to climb the mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                You have finally reached the top and see the enourmous entrance to the dragon's nest. At the entrance of the lair you see 
                several burnt corpses which must be all the knights who tried to slay the dragon before you. You begin to hesitate if fighting
                against the dragon is a good idea, but the thought of the beautiful princess lets you enter the giant cave.
                </p>
                <h3>Inside the dragon's lair</h3>
                <p>
                The cave goes through the whole mountain and seems like an endless maze, but you finally manage to reach the dragon's domain.
                There you see the giant beast lying on the stone floor. Fortunately it seems that is sleeping. You can't believe your luck and
                you look for the princess.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then you see her the most beautiful woman you have ever seen in your life. She is trapped inside a metal cage. You try to
                break the lock of her cage but all your efforts fail. You probably need the key to open it. Suddenly you hear loud roar behind
                you. You turn around and see the angry dragon chasing for you but you also see that it wears the key for the cage around its
                neck.
                </p>
                <p>
                You have no other choice. You must defeat the dragon.
                </p>
